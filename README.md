Udacity frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game 
===============================


Cross the bridge and avoid the man-eating bugs!!!

Rule:
1. Use arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to control the player
2. Collect rocks to protect yourself! 
3. If you are touched by the bugs, god will send you back to where you started(thank god!) and take away a rock from you


After you reach the water, press arrow key "up" to start the game again.

Have fun!
