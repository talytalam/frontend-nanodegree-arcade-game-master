Udacity frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game 
===============================


Cross the bridge and avoid the man-eating bugs!!!

How to play: 
1. Download all files from the repository
2. Open index.html in your browser

That's it!

Rule:
1. Use arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to control the player
2. Collect rocks along the way! 
3. If you are touched by the bugs, god will send you back to where you started(thank god!) and take away all rocks from you


After you reach the water, press arrow key "up" to start the game again.

Have fun!
