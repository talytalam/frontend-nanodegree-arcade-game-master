Udacity frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game 
===============================


Cross the bridge and avoid the man-eating bugs!!!

Rule:
1. Use arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to control the player
2. If you are touched by the bugs, god will send you back to where you started(thank god!)
3. If you are touched by the bugs for more than three time in a single attempt to cross the bridge, you will be eaten! (not yet implement)
4. Collect rocks to protect yourself! (not yet implement)

After you reach the water, press arrow key "up" to start the game again.

Have fun!
